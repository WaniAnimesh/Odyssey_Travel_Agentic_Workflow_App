Overview
This repository contains the submission for the GenAI Exchange Hackathon, showcasing a modular, agentic AI system designed to streamline knowledge workflows across diverse domains. Our prototype demonstrates how generative agents can collaborate, reason, and deliver high-impact results through a scalable orchestration framework.

üöÄ Key Features
Agentic Workflow Engine: Modular architecture enabling plug-and-play agents with distinct capabilities (retrieval, synthesis, presentation).

Domain-Agnostic Intelligence: Supports use cases across finance, healthcare, education, and more.

Natural Language Interface: Users interact via intuitive prompts, with agents coordinating behind the scenes.

Scalable & Extensible: Easily integrates new agents or tools without disrupting existing flows.

Presentation-Ready Output: Generates structured, judge-friendly responses suitable for demos and stakeholder review.

üß© Architecture
The system is built around a multi-agent orchestration layer, where each agent:

Operates independently with a defined role

Communicates via a shared memory and task queue

Can be swapped or extended for domain-specific needs

Agents include:

Retriever Agent: Gathers relevant data from internal or external sources

Synthesizer Agent: Summarizes and contextualizes information

Presenter Agent: Formats output for clarity and impact

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python (agent logic, orchestration)

Frameworks: LangChain, OpenAI API

Tools: Streamlit (UI), Pinecone (vector DB), GitHub Actions (CI/CD
