/**
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
 * This file will handle the logic for the post-trip scrapbook generation.
 * It will take user-uploaded photos and the original itinerary to create a
 * personalized digital scrapbook.
 * 
 * Example function:
 * 
 * export async function createScrapbook(tripPhotos, itinerary) {
 *   // 1. Process images with a Gemini vision model to identify locations, objects, and moods.
 *   // 2. Correlate photos with the itinerary data (e.g., "These photos were likely taken at the Louvre on Day 2").
 *   // 3. Use a "Storyteller Agent" to generate captions and a narrative for the trip.
 *   // 4. Arrange the photos and text into a visually appealing layout.
 *   // 5. Return the generated scrapbook data structure for the frontend to render.
 * }
