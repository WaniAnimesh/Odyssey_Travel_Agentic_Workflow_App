/**
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
 * This file will handle the API logic for the live chat assistant.
 * It will likely involve creating a chat session with an AI agent
 * that can dynamically adjust the user's itinerary based on real-time requests.
 * 
 * Example function:
 * 
 * export async function adjustItineraryViaChat(currentItinerary, userRequest) {
 *   // 1. Initialize a chat with the Planning Agent, providing the current itinerary as context.
 *   // 2. Send the user's request (e.g., "Find a vegetarian restaurant near me instead of the one planned for dinner").
 *   // 3. The agent would use tools (e.g., Google Places) to find a new option.
 *   // 4. Return the updated itinerary data structure.
 * }
