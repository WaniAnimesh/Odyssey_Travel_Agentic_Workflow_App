/**
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
 * This file will contain the logic for the AI-powered Augmented Reality guide.
 * It would receive an image or video stream from the user's camera,
 * identify the landmark, and return a narrative or key facts.
 * 
 * Example function:
 * 
 * export async function identifyLandmark(imageBase64) {
 *   // 1. Use a Gemini vision model to identify the landmark in the image.
 *   // 2. Create a prompt for an "AI Tour Guide" agent, asking for interesting facts about the identified landmark.
 *   // 3. The agent would generate a script for the AI avatar.
 *   // 4. Return the text and/or audio to be displayed/played in the frontend AR view.
 * }
